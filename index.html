    <h1 class="p-3">What is cloud computing, in simple terms?</h1>
    <p class="p-3">Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.</p>
    <h1 class="p-3">How does cloud computing work?</h1>
    <p class="p-3">Rather than owning their own computing infrastructure or data centres, companies can rent access to anything from applications to storage from a cloud service provider.

        One benefit of using cloud-computing services is that firms can avoid the upfront cost and complexity of owning and maintaining their own IT infrastructure, and instead simply pay for what they use, when they use it.
        
        In turn, providers of cloud-computing services can benefit from significant economies of scale by delivering the same services to a wide range of customers.</p>
    
    <h1 class="p-3">Top benefits of cloud computing</h1>
    <h4 class="p-3">Cost</h4>
    <p class="p-3">Cloud computing eliminates the capital expense of buying hardware and software and setting up and running on-site datacenters—the racks of servers, the round-the-clock electricity for power and cooling, and the IT experts for managing the infrastructure. It adds up fast.</p>
    <h4 class="p-3">Performance</h4>
    <p class="p-3">The biggest cloud computing services run on a worldwide network of secure datacenters, which are regularly upgraded to the latest generation of fast and efficient computing hardware. This offers several benefits over a single corporate datacenter, including reduced network latency for applications and greater economies of scale.</p>
    <h4 class="p-3">Global scale</h4>
    <p class="p-3" >The benefits of cloud computing services include the ability to scale elastically. In cloud speak, that means delivering the right amount of IT resources—for example, more or less computing power, storage, bandwidth—right when they’re needed, and from the right geographic location.    </p>


    <h1 class="p-3">Types of cloud services: IaaS, PaaS, serverless, and SaaS</h1>
    <p class="p-3">Most cloud computing services fall into four broad categories: infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), serverless, and software as a service (SaaS). These are sometimes called the cloud computing "stack" because they build on top of one another. Knowing what they are and how they’re different makes it easier to accomplish your business goals.</p>
    <h4 class="p-3">Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)</h4>
    <p class="p-3">The most basic category of cloud computing services. With IaaS, you rent IT infrastructure—servers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, operating systems—from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis.</p>
    <h4 class="p-3">Platform as a service (PaaS)</h4>
    <p class="p-3">Platform as a service refers to cloud computing services that supply an on-demand environment for developing, testing, delivering, and managing software applications. PaaS is designed to make it easier for developers to quickly create web or mobile apps, without worrying about setting up or managing the underlying infrastructure of servers, storage, network, and databases needed for development.</p>
    <h4 class="p-3">Software as a service (SaaS)</h4>
    <p class="p-3">Software as a service is a method for delivering software applications over the Internet, on demand and typically on a subscription basis. With SaaS, cloud providers host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure, and handle any maintenance, like software upgrades and security patching. Users connect to the application over the Internet, usually with a web browser on their phone, tablet, or PC.</p>
